jupyter notebook
00_introduction


see https://realpython.com/pointers-in-python/
there are NO pointers in python...
everything is an object

variables:
-mutable: can be changed, very few
-immutable: cannot be changed

differences with C++
C++ needs a compiler
python is interpreted on flight



this name points to this object 
(name, value, reference count)

when you update a variable you point to a name to another object, with a different reference count

you create a new object 

x is y??? pay attention
>>> x = 1000
>>> y = 1000
>>> x is y
True


>>> x = 1000
>>> y = 499 + 501
>>> x is y
False




print(3 / 4)   here they're considered as Float not Integers like in C++
print(3.0 / 4.0) its the same as the line before
print(3 % 4)  
print(3 // 4)  to divide as they're integers
print(3**4)    new way to write power 3^4
print(pow(3, 4))   old way



#iterators

#FOR LOOP simplified
for i in range(1,10): print (i)

#WHILE LOOP
i = 1
while i < 10:
    print(i)
    i+=1

#enumerate 
for i, j in enumerate([4,5,2,7]): print(i,j)




NOTE: you don't have to end line with ;
no brackets to define if,for.. statements just don't put them
but pay attention to the indentation!!



use # to comment the code


def to define functions
you don't need to specify the type of arguments you require in the function


Lists
think of a vector
defined by square brackets

a_list = [1, 2, 3, "this is a string", 5.3]
 you can put whatever you want in there

you can do a list of lists!!

Count starts from 0, like in C++



During the exam 
you can access reference pages of Python
documentation pages
of Numpy, Panda etc



Important thing: try to be as compact as possible


difference between list and <tuple

LIST ARE MUTABLE
TUPLE are IMMUTABLE


SETS used to store multiple items, NOT ordered, select only 1 elements for each value
you cannot store 2 times the same value
smth like in mathematics
